<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<p>
      My name is Pedro Luna and I'm an IoT professional. I've been working around this topic for ~6 years and have adopted diverse roles on several projects. From the very beginning, I have intended to learn the whole path to enable an IoT application, that, has lead me to learn a lot of things, from configure/program motes, to deploy, operate and maintain LoRa cloud services, or code end-user applications.
    </p>
    <p>Throught my way on mastering the Internet of things I have discovered two important things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always be open to new skills, ideas, and technologies.</li>
      <li>Have as much fun as you can in the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <!--p>Hence, I've decided to get some fun by building this server with the following specs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Server instance running on AWS.</li>
      <li>The instance is running on Linux.</li>
      <li>Http service, Email notifications and TTN connector coded in Go.</li>
      <li>Go-routines installed as OS service.</li>
      <li>Some content is delivered using Go and an HTML template, some other (like this text) is plain HTML since I don't have plans to change it frequently.</li>
    </ul-->
    <p>Feel free to take a tour to my projects and reposiries! If there is something that calls your attention and you like to know more about, you can send me an email to <strong><em>clutso@hotmail.com</em></strong>.</p>
<p> A good starting pont is to check <a href= "https://github.com/users/clutso/projects/1"> this project.</a> </p>
